# My Note Organization System

> How to build up my second brain? Things will sort themself out after I have reached critical mass. Just remember to refactor and clean-up.

Backstory: During my junior year in college, I went to a Stanford Hackathon and visited some fellow CS friends from Berkeley on my way back. They pitched me the idea of knowledge management using connected graph. We drew up the mock UI on a whiteboard in a library and decided to worked on a crude demo version.

What surprised me about Obsidian is that is looks exactly the same as what we had visualized on that whiteboard. Better yet, it is built by two software engineers during the pandemic. It is more technical compared to Notion, but a better tool for a denser knowledge management system.

Obsidian should be used as a presentable, publishable knowledge management tool, as opposed to a task management / productivity tool.

## To transition from Notion to Obsidian
- [x] How do I deal with calendar / task scheduling / productivity-related tasks? Move to Google Calendar.
- [x] How do I record daily entry like fitness / food journal, and general daily diary? Use NLP date tag and lump all feelings + food + fitness together.
- [x] Databases? move booklist into è±†ç“£

## How to organize notes of the same topic from multiple source?
For instance, if I am taking machine learning courses from multiple open source online course: should I be creating a single note for each course, or should the notes all be merged into one titled Machine Learning?
Each course should have its individual notes. When encountering similar concept, turn a concept into link (not necessarily a page by itself) to see how each source interconnects.

## My Personal System
- Evergreen: Obsidian should only contain **well-maintained** notes (write in full sentences). Keep all **time-sensitive** tasks in Google Calendar. Use **daily** notes as temporary, unsorted notes.
- Organization: Using **goals** as index.
- Granularity: Use **phrases** as links. Use more elaborate title, and add a README quote paragram summarizing the entry. When multiple literature sources are about the same topic, they should be recorded in the same file by topic, rather than by sources.
- Use **tag** for version control and status tracking for publishable content
	- status: status/draft to status/final
	- privacy: notes default as visibility/public, those publishable should have visibility/shareable
	- select notes from final to publish, and mark them as visibility/public

### Zettelkasten method
- _Fleeting Note_Â ðŸŸ© - Used for capturing ideas quickly. They serve as mere reminders of information and can be written in a variety of ways. Taking them should not distract you from your work.
- _Permanent Note_Â ðŸŸ¥ - Used to capture ideas from text (literature note) or used to elaborate on and create an atomic note (permanent slip-box note). Permanent means they are kept forever.
- _Project Note_Â ðŸŸ¨ - Used to capture information pertaining to a particular project. Kept together in a project-specific folder and are archived or discarded when the project is finished.
