## Logistics
- Course homepage: [https://cs007.blog/](https://cs007.blog/)
- Overview: Standford, CS 007, Fall 2020, 1 credit, 10 sessions
- Instructor: Adam Samuel Nash
- Course description: Introduction to the fundamentals and analysis specifically needed by engineers to make informed and intelligent financial decisions. Course will focus on actual industry-based financial information from technology companies and realistic financial issues. Topics include: behavioral finance, budgeting, debt, compensation, stock options, investing and real estate. No prior finance or economics experience required.


## Session 1: Introduction
- Why personal Finance? Personal finance is poorly covered in school. Though not technically difficult, the signal-to-noise ratio is terrible. It has massive impact on our lifes and affects everyone.
- Why for engineers? Engineers are typically well educated in math and enjoy it. Face significant financial decisions early in life. Tend to believe they are rational decision makers. Creates products that can affect the finances of billions.
- This class will focus on real data. Optimized for students graduating soon.
- In-class survey results:
    - Definition of wealth/success vary widely. Many parents are conflicted and ill-prepared to talk about money.
    - Owning stock can be a path to learning about companies and investing. Investing in equities, ideally through an index fund, can be one of the best ways to build long term wealth.
    - Ignoring the after-tax value of a financial decision can led to serious financial mistakes. An irrational fear of taxes can also lead to poor financial decision making.
    - Student load default rate is 10.9%.
    - What percentage of salary should you save? Spend less than you make. There is no magic rate of savings, but when you save you win by lowering living goals and more capital to invest.
    - Liquidity (having access to money when you need it) matters.
    - Median household income in Silicon Valley (Santa Clara) was $126,606 in 2018. Median national household income is $61,937 in 2018.

## Session 2: Behavioral Finance
- We are not rational! Why behavioral economics? Assume humans are rational, but Daniel Kahneman & Amos Tversky (Nobel Prize in Econs) propsed the Prospect Theory, which is a behavioral model that shows how people decide between alternatives that involve risk and uncertainty
- There are 3 themes in behvairoal economics
    - heuristics: decisions based on mental shortcuts or rules of thumb
    - framing: use anecdotes and stereotupes to understand and respond to events
    - market inefficiencies: mis-pricing or non-rational decision making
- Examples
    - anchoring: estimate answer to novel problems with a bias towards reference points (high point for a stock based on price the stock is bought at)
    - mental accounting: bucketing money into mental accounts (found money, vacation fund vs credit card debt)
    - confirmation & hindsight bias: selectively seek confirming information, overestimate out ability to predict
    - gambler's fallacy: patterns in independent, random events
    - herd behavior: crowd psychology may be a contributor to bubbles (empty supermarket)
    - overconfidence: Dunning-Krug effect states that the more poorly you perform, the more you over-estimated your performance, capability in one domain lead to overconfidence in others
    - recency & availability bias: we overreact to recent events, and we aassume the data we have is representative fo the entire data set
    - loss aversion (prospect theory): we hate losses more than we love winning. We even hate being responsible for decisions that could result in a loss (sunk cost mistakes with investments)
- It is OK to not be rational
    - we are *predictably* irrational
    - self awareness is key to set up systems to help account for them

## Session 3: Compensation
- How are people getting paid? Attract talent to company, motivate employees, retain employees
- Compnents: base pay, relocation/signing bonus, annual bonus, equity compensation, financial benefits, perks
    - base pay depents on level, function and geography. Market data accessible and adjustments are most commonly made due to annual inflation, internal audit, market competitiveness, and promotion
    - bonus: signing bonus/relocation usually has a clawback, performance bonus based on both individual & company results, spot bonus (less common) is one-off bonus to reward results
    - equity: designed to align employee compensation with shareholder results. Two common forms: stock options & restricted stock
    - financial benefits & perks: tax adventages, health insurance, retirement, stock purchases, food, transit, fitness
    - equity is a share of ownership of the business
        - market price for public companies' stock and options are extremely transparent
        - for private companies, future financing mean dilution. Evaluate base on the amount raised and at what terms and preferences. Cannot sell stock when company is private
    - stock options are a "derivative", a security based on another security. They represent "the right to buy". There are tax consequences. Intrinsic value is market price. Time value adds the value of the option itself and the flexibility it provides
    - restricted stock units (RSUs) are a promise form a company to issue shares to the employee. There is no strike price. You are granted a number of shares with a vesting schedule. You owe income taxes immediately when you vest restricted stock.
    - stock options vs restricted stock: unable to sell restricted until IPO or acquisition, but restricted stock worth more (lacks a strike price). Significant benefits with stock options
- Evaluting offers: FANG, unicorn tech private, next big thing, too big to fail jumbo bank
- It is never just about money:
    - For equity, what is the potential upside and dowside in the value of the company?
    - Company success disproportionately affects job offers from future companies, but success in technology can be fleeting.
    - Title vs Compensation vs Quality
    - Talent & network matters significantly
    - Building skills / experiences / achivements with lasting value
    - The market is fairely efficient, but it does not compensate for all types of risk
- Negotiate
    - companies vary significantly in approach, be polite but firm
    - know the market data
    - understand the different roles between a recruiter & manager
    - be emotionally honest with yourself on what is a deal breaker

## Session 4: Saving & Budgeting
- Don't buy stuff you cannot afford.
    - Spend less than you make
        - this is the ultimate secret to personal financial success
        - important at almost every level of income and wealth
        - important for all levels of success and intelligence
        - very easy to measure, few people do
    - Why is this difficult?
        - not all expenses happen in the same time frame as income
        - not all expenses are predictable
        - endowment effect can be counter-productive (budget for clothing = license to spend more than you need)
        - credit card make it trivial to overspend
        - income fluctuates but lifestyle and expenses are sticky 由俭入奢易
        - taxes are complicated
    - Stop keeping up with the Joneses
        - we do this to show off success, and to satisfy out need to have what other people have
        - well they are broke and you have to set your own priorities
- How much should you save?
    - every % matters: lower the amount need on lifestyle, increase the pool of capital to hit that goal
    - Employer benefits to saving
        - unfortunately, most people spend more than their expected bonus before they receive it
        - boost savings rates by: forced savings, employer match, health savings accounts
    - Morgage as forced saving
        - paying off debt wipes a liability off your books, leaving the asset. This boosts your net work, just like savings does
    - The benefits of automation
        - pay yourself first. build a budget, opt-out enrollment in 401(k), boost saving rate over time. Money not seen is less likely to be spent
- Budgeting
    - breakdown of spending by category
    - track empirical vs ideal results
    - needs vs wants vs savings and debts
    - you can make it work: beware of emotional justification like "I've earned this" "I deserve this" or "why not me"
- Income statement
    - company's financial performance over a specific accounting period
    - a personal income statement reviews a time period including income, expenses, and savings
    - use pay stub as a source for income data, use last 3 months of spending as the best source for expenses, use colleagues/friends/family as the best source for comparables
- Ongoing maintenance
    - quarterly: check your progress, real vs expected
    - annual: model in changes & learnings from real behavior
    - automate: make less room for error

## Session 5: Assets & Net Worth
- Liquidity: access to money when you need it
    - market liquidity: extent a marketplace allows assets to be bought & sold at stable prices
    - accounting liquidity: the ease an individual or company can meet their financial obligations with the liquid assets available to them
    - liquidity matters: the power to take advantage of investment opportunities
    - inversely correlated with returns (cash is very liquid, private equity is very illiquid)
- Emergency funds: a financial buffer to protect your goals
    - at least 3 months of living expenses in cash or cash-equivalents (based on the impact of losing employment)
    - it is an insurance/buffer, not an asset. First on the list to fill, first to refill it tapped for emergency (not frivolous needs)
- Assets & liabilities: what you own & what you owe
    - financial assets are investments in cash, bonds, stock, etc
    - real assets are investments in real estate, collectible, commodities, etc
    - types of assets: liquid vs illiquid, financial vs real, appreciating vs depreciating, tangible vs intangible, debt owed to you
    - liability is a financial obligation, typically debts
    - common types: mortgage, auto loan, student load, credit cards, tax liability
    - types of liabilites: short term vs long term, secured vs unsecured, tax liability
    - building a good credit score is essential for qualifying for most loans. It depends on length of history, on time payment, percent of capacity utilized, new applications for debt, bankruptcy
    - is debt a bad thing? Modigliani-Miller market value is determined by earning power & risk of underlying assets, not by the method of financing
    - should I pay off all of my debt? more debt = more risk. emotionally satistfying but financially irrational, tho can improve saving rates over time
- Balance sheet: know your net worth
    - assets - liability, total network include all assets, liquid net work excludes illiquid assets & primary home (are related liabilities). Do not confuse with cash flow.
    - a balance sheet is a financial sattement that summarises a companies assets, liabilites and shareholders' equity
        - assets = liability + equity
        - create your personal balance sheet (exclude primary residence)

## Session 6: Debt
- Compounding: good for savings, bad for debt
    - annual percentage rate (APR) vs APY
        - APR = simple interest (ratio)
        - APY = compound interest (exponential)
    - start early, componding over time
- Types of debt: student loads, mortage, auto, credit cards
    - common morgage: 30 year fixed, 5/1 ARMl, refinancing is common
    - auto loans: 3-5 years, fixed rate
    - credit card: key component of credit score!
- Credit score: payment history, amount owed, credit hisotry, types of credit, new credit
- Amortization: reduce the value of a load by a periodic amount
- Paying off debt: prioritize high interest rate

## Session 7: Investing
- Types of investments: stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate
    - stock is a security that represents ownership in a corporation

    - taxes matter
- How to invest: what to do & why you do it
    - brokerage accounts at large bank
    - how do you measure investment return?
        - alpha is defined as excess return over the market rate of return
        - beta is defined as the measure of volatility compared to its market benchmark over time
        - the key is to achieve the best risk-adjusted return, net of free & taxes
    - types of investment approach
        - Fundamental analysis attempts to choose securities based on the business performance & valuation.
        - Technical analysis attempts to choose securities based on price patterns.
        - Neither have demonstrated credible & repeatable above-market risk- adjusted performance net of fees in practice for the average professional.
        - Fundamental analysis is very useful as a business owner & operator. Warren Buffett annual letters are famous for good reason.
    - the secular rise of index funds
        - Large difference between broad, market based index funds (like VTI) and niche index funds based on alternate approaches or subsets of the market.
        - Factor-based investing has credible academic evidence, but the primary issue in practice has been high fees.
- GOOD INVESTING IS BORING otherwise, you are doing it wrong.
    - You will beat most mutual funds, hedge funds & your peers with simple, low cost index funds.
    - Most professionals fail to beat a simple market-weighted index, net of fees. (from A Random Walk down Wall Street)
    - The average equity investor underperformed due to high fees and market timing errors
